Consider the current stock price and a list of news articles, then determine the new price based on the expected impact of the news.\n\nUse provided inputs in JSON format and calculate a reasonable new stock price based on the nature of the given news. Each news item may have a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the stock.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Process Input**: Receive the input JSON containing the company's current stock price and a list of news items.\n2. **Analyze News Impact**: For each piece of news, determine if its tone is positive, negative, or neutral.\n   - Consider news sentiment, importance, and relevance.\n3. **Adjust Stock Price**: Depending on the combined influence of the news items:\n   - Positive news should boost the price.\n   - Negative news should decrease the price.\n   - Neutral/balanced news should not significantly affect the stock price.\n4. **Reason Calculation**: Provide a reasoning step determining how each news item influences the stock price.\n5. **Output Result**: Output the adjusted stock price as JSON, including a breakdown of how each news item affected the final value.\n\n# Output Format\n\nThe output should be in JSON format with the following structure:\n- `asset`: the name of the asset.\n- `current_price`: the original price provided.\n- `news_effect`: a list detailing each news item's effect.\n- `new_price`: the calculated new stock price.\n\nExample Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"asset\": \"[Company Name]\",\n  \"current_price\": [Current Price],\n  \"news_effect\": [\n    {\n      \"news\": \"[News headline or summary]\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"positive/negative/neutral\",\n      \"impact\": \"[Description of the impact on price]\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"new_price\": [Calculated New Price]\n}\n```\n\n# Example\n\n### Input:\n```json\n{\n  \"asset\": \"TechCo\",\n  \"current_price\": 150.00,\n  \"news\": [\n    \"TechCo reports 20% increase in quarterly revenue.\",\n    \"Lawsuit filed against TechCo over privacy concerns.\",\n    \"TechCo launches new smartphone model.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- News headline 1: Positive news, will likely boost stock price due to strong earnings.\n- News headline 2: Negative news, expected to partially offset gains due to potential legal costs.\n- News headline 3: New product launch, likely positive, but depends on market response.\n\n### Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"asset\": \"TechCo\",\n  \"current_price\": 150.00,\n  \"news_effect\": [\n    {\n      \"news\": \"TechCo reports 20% increase in quarterly revenue.\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"positive\",\n      \"impact\": \"+5.00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"news\": \"Lawsuit filed against TechCo over privacy concerns.\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"negative\",\n      \"impact\": \"-2.50\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"news\": \"TechCo launches new smartphone model.\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"positive\",\n      \"impact\": \"+3.00\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"new_price\": 155.50\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n- With conflicting news, the model should try to balance the impact proportionally.\n- Some news might not have significant impact. In such cases, the impact can be zero.\n- Consider edge cases like highly impactful news or unclear sentiment and provide a conservative change.\n",
